What is a null value in kotlin? How does kotlin ensures null safety? Show with examples.

Null value in kotlin indicates that a variable or property does not currently hold any
meaningful data

var string1: String? = "Hello"
string1 = null // Assigning null is allowed

var string2: String = "Hello"
string2 = null // Compilation error: Null cannot be a value of a non-null type
