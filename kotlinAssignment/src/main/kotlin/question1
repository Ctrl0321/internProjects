Describe the difference between var & val. Which one we should ideally be using in our projects?


Var -  var stand for variable and var used to declare mutable variables (Value can change)
Val -  val stands for value and val used to declare immutable variables (Value cannot change)

We ideally using val for declaring variables because helps make our code more predictable but some case we need a mutable variables that time we have to use a var for that
